Email Spam Classifier
This project aims to develop an Email Spam Classifier using machine learning techniques to accurately classify emails as spam or not. The classifier is built using Python programming language and leverages various natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.

Introduction
The Email Spam Classifier project focuses on efficiently identifying spam emails, thus protecting users' inboxes from unwanted and potentially harmful messages. By utilizing a combination of text preprocessing techniques, feature extraction, and a trained machine learning model, the classifier predicts the spam or non-spam label for a given email.

Installation
To run the Email Spam Classifier project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.

Install the required dependencies.

Download the necessary NLTK resources.

Usage
To use the Email Spam Classifier, follow these steps:

Preprocess the input email message using the transform_sms function defined in preprocessing.py.

Load the trained model and TF-IDF vectorizer.

Vectorize the preprocessed message using the TF-IDF vectorizer.

Predict the email's label (spam or not) using the trained model.

Display the prediction result.

Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing pipeline involves several steps to clean and prepare the email messages for classification. These steps include converting the text to lowercase, tokenization, removing non-alphanumeric characters, removing stopwords and punctuation, and applying stemming using the Porter stemmer.

Model Training
The machine learning model used for email classification is trained using a labeled dataset consisting of spam and non-spam emails. The training involves feature extraction, typically using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique, and training a classification algorithm such as Naive Bayes.
Evaluation
The performance of the Email Spam Classifier is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision. These metrics provide insights into the classifier's effectiveness in correctly identifying spam and non-spam emails.

Deployment
To deploy the Email Spam Classifier, it can be integrated into an application or web service where users can input email messages and receive predictions on their spam or non-spam status. This can be achieved using frameworks such as Flask or Django.
